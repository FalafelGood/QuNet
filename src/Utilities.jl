After purification, this function adds a channel between the src and dst with
the purified costs and information about the Pathset.

Strictly speaking this is an edge-vertex-edge. The reason we implement it this
way is two-fold. First, consider purification between two adjacent nodes.
Simple graphs like MetaDiGraphs can't allow for multiple edges between the same
two nodes. Secondly, and more subtly, having a designated purification channel
allows us to have multiple purification sets between a given end-user pair.
This could be useful in testing protocols in which we iterate through multiple
purification rounds.
